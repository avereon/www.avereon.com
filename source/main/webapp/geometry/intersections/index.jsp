<h1>Intersections</h1>
<p>Calculating the intersections of 2D and 3D geometric objects is a
rather tedious task once you get beyond simple lines and planes. This is
mainly due to the complexity or non-existence of generalized equations
to calculate these intersections. Calculating intersections is therefore
more easily done numerically, using <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation">parametric
equations</a>, instead of analytically.</p>
