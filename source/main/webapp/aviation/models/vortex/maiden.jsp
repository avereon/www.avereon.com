<h1>Vortex Maiden Flight</h1>
<p>In early April the temperatures finally warmed up enough to melt off the
snow and dry out the flying field enough for a maiden flight. On Thursday, 8
April 2010, the Vortex flew for the first time. The maiden flight was rough for
two reasons. First, the elevator trim was way off and it took me a while to get
it settled out. The other reason was I had programmed the control to use full
exponential movement on the control surfaces. That was a mistake since I had
never flown that way before and had no idea what it would be like. Fortunately,
I landed the plane safely and even had the courage for a second flight that also
ended successfully.</p>

<p>On Saturday, 10 Apr 2010, I went out for another flight. This time I was
more confident and after taking off started testing out the performance of the
plane. After several sharp turns and a couple of rolls I lost reference on the
plane and I crashed it nose first into the grass field where I fly. The canopy
survived but the remainder of the nose was destroyed. For a moment I considered
just building a new plane but figured it would take less time to repair this
one.</p>
