<h1>Final Flight</h1>

<p>On the afternoon, after adjusting the center of gravity again, I went out
for a solo flight. I flew for several minutes with the plane "ducking" several
times without incident. Being at the end of the battery charge, I came around
for a landing approach. Just before turning on the final approach the plane
"ducked" again. I decided to pull back on the throttle a little more to soften
the flight but just as I did the plane "ducked" hard again, nose diving right
into the ground. This time the entire fuselage was destroyed and I have decided
not to rebuild the plane.</p>

<p>It has been an interesting experiment in aircraft design and I will
likely try a similar design in the future.</p>
