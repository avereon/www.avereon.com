# Xeomar Repositories

Below are some sample repository base URLs. They are intended to stir ideas and
provoke thought how to stage and access Xeomar repositories.

-- These examples show different base URLs for the same distribution:
http://xeomar.com/download/stable
http://www.xeomar.com/download/stable
http://xeomar.com/market/stable
http://market.xeomar.com/stable
http://download.xeomar.com/market/stable

-- These examples use the same base URL and show distribution options:
http://market.xeomar.com/eppler (distribution code name)
http://market.xeomar.com/handy (distribution code name)
http://market.xeomar.com/stable (distribution alias)
http://market.xeomar.com/latest (distribution alias)

-- This example with a specific version number should not be used
http://market.xeomar.com/xenon/1.0 (don't like the specific version here)

# The Debian Pattern
<type:str> <repository:url> <distribution:str> [<component:str>...]

Following the Debian pattern (Note that this is configuration for the repository
not necessarily that it is enabled)

typ url                                     dist   comp1  comp2
--- --------------------------------------- ------ ------ --------
xeo http://download.xeomar.com/market/xenon stable latest backport

Distribution >aliases or release classes< are useful for connecting to a
distribution for a particular purpose. For example, the stable alias can point
to a particular distribution today and me moved to a new one in the future.
Distributions could be considered containers for releases which, in turn, are
identified by specific version numbers. Distribution is similar if not the same
concept as a channel (current working name in Xeomar repos). One item to note
is that a distribution contains only one version/release of any specific product
but may contain many products. The artifacts of individual products should
generally be updated at the same time, but not necessarily the artifacts of
other products.

Components are not necessarily a concept used in Xeomar repos. Components are
intended to separate packages with different licenses and therefore different
restrictions on use. This can be accomplished with a different repo and/or
license inclusion in a package.
