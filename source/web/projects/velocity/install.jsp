<h1>Installing Velocity</h1>
<p>To install Velocity on most platforms simply <a
	href="update/velocity-install.jar">download</a> and run the
velocity-install.jar as a Java application by double-clicking on the file or
running 'java -jar velocity-install.jar' from the command line. Follow the
instructions in the installer.</p>
<h2>Windows Installation Notes</h2>
<p>The Velocity installer will install Velocity to %USER_HOME%\Program
Files\Velocity by default on Windows operating systems. This is primarily to
avoid problems with the Windows Vista User Account Control (UAC) which does not
allow applications to write to the Program Files folder without elevated
privileges (using the administrator account). Installing Velocity on previous
versions of Windows does not have this issue and Velocity can safely be
installed in Program Files folder like normal.</p>
