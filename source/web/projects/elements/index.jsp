<h1>Velocity Elements Module</h1>
<p>Elements is a Velocity module for computer aided design 
intended for general engineering needs. It features common 2D/3D
entities and editing tools.</p>
<p>The origin of the name for the Elements module comes from the
treatise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements">Elements</a>
written by Euclid circa 300 BC. Euclid is often referred to as the
"Father of Geometry" and therefore seemed fitting as a first endeavor
for a 3D geometry modeling package.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>In order to install Elements add the following module location in Velocity:</p>
