<h1>Elements Module</h1>
<p>Elements is a 3D computer aided engineering module for Velocity. It is
intended for general engineering needs and features common 2D/3D entities and
editing tools.</p>
<p>The origin of the name for the Elements module comes from the treatise <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements">Elements</a> written by
Euclid circa 300 BC. Euclid is often referred to as the "Father of Geometry" and
therefore seemed fitting as a first endeavor for a 3D engineering package.</p>
