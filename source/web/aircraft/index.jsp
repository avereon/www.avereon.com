<h1>Model Aircraft</h1>
<p>There are three main activities for model aircraft enthusiasts:
designing, building, and flying. Most people are interested mainly in flying
model aircraft and usually purchase kits that come mostly built with only some
finishing assembly required. Some people enjoy the craft of building model
aircraft and will purchase kits that need to be completely assembled. There is
great satisfaction in completing and flying a model you have constructed. There
are even fewer people that take on the challenge of designing their own
aircraft. The chance of first-time success, designing, building, and flying your
own model, is quite small. But don't let that discourage you. There is a great 
sense of accomplishment successfully flying your own aircraft designs.</p>
