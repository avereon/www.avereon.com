<h1>Vortex Project</h1>
<p>In the summer of 2008 I was ready to start on another aircraft project.
Wanting to build an enhance Typhoon class aircraft I started designing. But I
soon became interested in the long tail of our pet lizard Ernie and started
thinking of something with slim lines an a long thin fuselage. After a couple of
nights of sketching the initial outline for the Vortex was complete.</p>

<p>Soon I was ready to start designing. I started looking for CAD programs
for my computer but didn't find any in the price range that I could justify for
hobby work. Being a software engineer by profession I decided to try making a
CAD program of my own. It turns out that was a very time consuming project in
and of itself. I spend all of the fall of 2008 and winter, spring and most of
the summer of 2009 writing a basic 3D CAD program. All along the way working
slowly on the Vortex design.</p>
<p>By late summer 2009 I had completed enough of the CAD program and Vortex
design that it was time to get to building the aircraft. Work commenced
seriously on Wednesday, 2 Sep 2009. By Saturday, 5 Sep 2009 the basic parts had
been formed and <a href="../../images/vortex/CIMG3617.1.JPG">construction
began</a>. By Friday, 11 Sep 2009 the major parts of the aircraft had been assembled
and the detail work was started. (Note: I took the week, 7 Sep to 12 Sep, off
from work.)</p>
