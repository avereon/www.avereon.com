<h1>Vortex Construction</h1>

<p>By late summer 2009 I had completed enough of the CAD program and Vortex
design that it was time to get to building the aircraft. Work commenced
seriously on Wednesday, 2 Sep 2009. By Saturday, 5 Sep 2009 the basic parts had
been formed and <a href="../../images/vortex/CIMG3617.1.JPG">construction
began</a>. By Friday, 11 Sep 2009 the major parts of the aircraft had been assembled
and the detail work was started. (Note: I took the week, 7 Sep to 12 Sep, off
from work.)</p>

<p>The planking work took much longer than anticipated. It took two more
months to complete the planking. I finally completed the aircraft on Saturday,
21 Nov 2009. But by this time the temperatures had dropped and the snow had set
in. I would have to wait until spring for the maiden flight.</p>
