<h1>Unique Aircraft</h1>
<p>Most of us are familiar with &quot;standard&quot; aircraft that we have
been around for years. Standard aircraft follow some basic rules that most do
not deviate from. A standard aircraft has a fuselage, a main wing, and tail
surfaces. These aircraft are standard because it is simple to make reliable
aircraft in this manner. The structures are simple and the aerodynamics are
simple.</p>
<p>These pages are dedicated to non-standard, fixed wing, aircraft.
Non-standard aircraft are those that have non-standard structure or non-standard
aerodynamics.</p>
