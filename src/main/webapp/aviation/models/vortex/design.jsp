<h1>Vortex Design</h1>
<p>In the summer of 2008 I was ready to start on another aircraft project.
Wanting to build an enhance Typhoon class aircraft I started designing. I was
soon sidetracked by the long tail of our pet lizard, Ernie, and started thinking
of something with slim lines an a long thin fuselage. After a couple of nights
of sketching the initial outline for the Vortex was complete.</p>

<p>Soon I was ready to start designing. I started looking for CAD programs
for my computer but didn't find any in the price range that I could justify for
hobby work. Being a software engineer by profession I decided to try making a
CAD program of my own. It turns out that was a very time consuming project in
and of itself. I spend all of the fall of 2008 and winter, spring and most of
the summer of 2009 writing a basic 3D CAD program. All along the way working
slowly on the Vortex design.</p>
