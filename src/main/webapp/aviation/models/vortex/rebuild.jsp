<h1>Vortex Rebuild</h1>

<p>I was unfortunately busy during the summer of 2010 but towards the end I
took and entire week, 30 Aug to 4 Sep, off from work again, just like I did the
previous year, and repaired the plane.</p>

<p>On Labor Day morning, Monday 6 Sep 2020 my wife son and I took the
repaired plane out for a new maiden flight. The flight went well except for a
"ducking" motion every one in a while during flight but I managed to land
safely. I thought that it might be due to the center of gravity being too far
back so I added a little bit of weight to the nose and went for a second flight.
The "ducking" problem seemed to be a little better but was still present so I
pulled back the throttle and made a high angle of attack landing which went
smoothly.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon after adjusting the weight again I went out for a
solo flight. I flew for several minutes with the plane "ducking" several times
without incident. Being at the end of the battery charge I came around for a
landing approach but just before turning on the final approach the plane
"ducked" again. I decided to pull back on the throttle a little more to soften
the flight but just as I did the plane "ducked" hard again, nose diving right
into the ground. This time the entire fuselage was destroyed and I have decided
not to rebuild the plane.</p>

<p>It has been an interesting experiment in aircraft design and I will
likely try a similar design in the future.</p>
