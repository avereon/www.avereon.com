<h4>HiDPI Monitors</h4>
<p>Support the use of high DPI monitors over the use of standard DPI
	monitors. Over time the pixel density of monitors had hovered between 80 and
	120 DPI. With the introduction of the Apple Retina display in 2010 the DPI
	increased significantly and now there are many monitors with DPI counts
	above 150.

<h4>Return the User to Where They Were</h4>
<p>
	Return the user where they left off. Whenever the program is restarted it
	should return the user to where they left off unless the user specifically
	changes the settings not to.
