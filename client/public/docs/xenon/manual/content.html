	<p>
		Welcome, and thank you for using Xenon, a simple application framework. Xenon
		is a framework that provides services common to modern desktop applications
		like selection tabs, dockable work area, notifications and many others. We
		hope you find this program useful as you get to know its features and
		capabilities. We particularly encourage you to <a href="/product/xenon/mods">
		discover the mods</a> available for Xenon that provide capabilities to
		accomplish all kinds of tasks.
	</p>


	<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
	<p>
		If you have not done so already, <a href='/product/xenon'>start by downloading
		the Xenon installer</a> for your platform. Once downloaded, run the installer
		to install Xenon. Once installed Xenon can be found by searching for Xenon
		in the start menu or application finder of your operating system.
	</p>

	<h4 id="terminology">Terminology</h4>
	<p>
		In the course of reading this document, you will run across a number of terms
		that have specific meaning in Xenon. This section serves as a brief introduction
		to some of the concepts and terminology used in Xenon as well as an explanation
		for each.

	<h6>Tool</h6>
	<h6>Action</h6>
	<h6>Program Home</h6>
	<p>
		This is the location where the program is installed and from where the program
		executes. The location of the program home is different across platforms but
		the structure is the same. The following table shows the default program home
		for common platforms
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Linux</td>
			<td>$HOME/.local/share/xenon</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Mac OS</td>
			<td>/Applications/Xenon.app/Contents</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

	<h6>Product</h6>
	<p>
		The program and mods are collectively referred to as products. You will notice
		that program updates and mod updates are handled with the same tools and
		workflow. Anytime you see the term product it may refer to either the program,
		mods or both.

	<h4 id="user-experience-principles">User Experience Principles</h4>
	<h6>HiDPI Monitors</h6>
	<p>Support the use of high DPI monitors over the use of standard DPI
		monitors. Over time the pixel density of monitors had hovered between 80 and
		120 DPI. With the introduction of the Apple Retina display in 2010 the DPI
		increased significantly and now there are many monitors with DPI counts
		above 150.
	</p>
	<h6>Pick Up Where You Left Off</h6>
	<p>
		Return the user where they left off. Whenever the program is restarted it
		should return the user to where they left off unless the user specifically
		changes the settings not to. This means that the program should open the same
		number of workspaces with the same number of workareas and the same tools and
		resources loaded.
	</p>

	<h2 id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</h2>
	<p>
		Xenon provides a command line interface to start and interact with the
		program. The command line interface requires that the program be executable
		from the command line. It is recommended to add the program home bin folder
		to your PATH environment variable for convenience.
