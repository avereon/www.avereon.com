	<p>
		Welcome, and thank you for using Xenon, a simple application framework. Xenon
		is a framework that provides services common to modern desktop applications
		like selection tabs, dockable work area, notifications and many others. We
		hope you find this program useful as you get to know its features and
		capabilities. We particularly encourage you to <a href="/product/xenon/mods">
		discover the mods</a> available for Xenon that provide capabilities to
		accomplish all kinds of tasks.
	</p>

	<h3 id="download-and-install">Download and Install</h3>
	<p>
		If you are new to Xenon, the installers for current versions are found on
		the <a href='/product/xenon'>Xenon product page</a>. Once downloaded, run
		the installer to install Xenon. When installed Xenon can be found by
		searching for Xenon in the start menu or application finder of your
		operating system.
	</p>

	<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
	<p>
		In the course of reading this document, you will run across a number of terms
		that have specific meaning in Xenon. This section serves as a brief introduction
		to some of the concepts and terminology used in Xenon as well as an explanation
		for each.
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Program</dt>
		<dd>Xenon uses the term program refer to the program itself. This term is
			used in place of application for simplicity and to avoid ambiguity in the
			term application.

	<dl>
		<dt>Program Home</dt>
		<dd>
			This is the location where the program is installed and from where the program
			executes. The location of the program home is different across platforms but
			the structure is the same. The following table shows the default program home
			location for common platforms:
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Linux</td>
					<td>$HOME/.local/share/xenon</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Mac OS</td>
					<td>/Applications/Xenon.app/Contents</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Windows</td>
					<td>C:\Program Files\Xenon</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>Product</dt>
		<dd>
			The program and mods are collectively referred to as products. You will notice
			that program updates and mod updates are handled with the same tools and
			workflow. Anytime you see the term product it may refer to either the program,
			mods or both.

	<dl>
		<dt>Product Market</dt>

			products.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2 id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</h2>
	<p>
		Xenon provides a command line interface to start and interact with the
		program. The command line interface requires that the program be executable
		from the command line. It is recommended to add the program home bin folder
		to your PATH environment variable for convenience.
	</p>
	<p>The general pattern for the Xenon command line is:</p>
	<code>xenon [option...] [uri...]</code>

	<h3 id="cli-uris">URIs (Resources)</h3>
	<p>
		Providing a URI to Xenon on the command line instructs Xenon to treat the
		URI as a resource and attempt to open that resource after starting. Any
		valid URI should be acceptable but may not be able to be supported by Xenon
		if a supporting mod has not been installed. Any URI that does not specify a
		scheme will be interpreted as a file URI. Relative URIs will be resolved
		against user.path system property of the invoking JVM.
	</p>

	<h3 id="control-options">Control Options</h3>
	<p>
		Several options control the operation of the program allowing some level of
		automation. If Xenon is run without any control option then the program is
		simply started normally. If the existing process was
		<a href="#cli-option-profile">started with a profile</a>, the control
		option must also provide the same profile name to affect the desired instance.
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>--stop</dt>
		<dd>
			Stop the program immediately. Using this option does not prompt the user
			that the program is stopping, will close all workspaces and will attempt
			to terminate the program normally.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>--status</dt>
		<dd>
			Get the status of the program. If the program is not running then this
			option prints that the program is not running and exits immediately.
			If the program is running, this option prints that the program is running
			and exits this instance of the program immediately, leaving the previously
			running instance as it was.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>--watch</dt>
		<dd>
			Watch the output of an existing program instance. This instance will
			continue to watch the existing instance until this instance is terminated,
			usually by typing Ctrl-C on the keyboard. It is possible to have multiple
			watching instances for any normal instance.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="cli-option-profile">--profile &lt;name&gt;</dt>
		<dd>
			Start the program with a named profile. Normally this is not necessary but
			in cases where the user wants to have separate instances of the program
			running at the same time each instance will need a different profile.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

	<dl>
		<dt>--log-level &lt;level&gt;</dt>
		<dd>
			Start the program with a named profile. Normally this is not necessary but
			in cases where the user wants to have separate instances of the program
			running at the same time each instance will need a different profile.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3 id="user-experience-principles">User Experience Principles</h3>
	<h6>HiDPI Monitors</h6>
	<p>Support the use of high DPI monitors over the use of standard DPI
		monitors. Over time the pixel density of monitors had hovered between 80 and
		120 DPI. With the introduction of the Apple Retina display in 2010 the DPI
		increased significantly and now there are many monitors with DPI counts
		above 150.
	</p>
	<h6>Pick Up Where You Left Off</h6>
	<p>
		Return the user where they left off. Whenever the program is restarted it
		should return the user to where they left off unless the user specifically
		changes the settings not to. This means that the program should open the same
		number of workspaces with the same number of workareas and the same tools and
		resources loaded.
